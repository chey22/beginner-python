<h2>Lab 1: Data Types and Iterations</h2>

<h4>Deadline: May 6th, 11:59 PM</h4>

**I.  Overview**
From last week's lecture we talked about data types mainly, with an intro to iterations. The first module will be strictly about data types and structures while the second module will be about iterations and interacting with data types. **I highly recommend going ahead and completing module 1 before Wednesday and doing module 2 after lecture this week since we will talk about iterations during that class. This lab you must write your own tests!**

**II.  Module 1: Data Types**
In the file `lab_01.py`, complete the function `extract_from_list`. 

**III.  Module 2: Practice with iteration** ([Link for iteration in python](https://blog.logrocket.com/for-while-loops-python/))
In the file `lab_01.py`, complete the remaining functions. You may find it helpful to go back and look at the lecture 1 recording to remind about data types. Iteration will become more clear after lecture but if you want to go ahead and get a jump start I recommend doing so.


<h4>Deliverables:</h4>

1. A screenshot of all the outputs (labeled so I know which function is which) from `lab_01.py`
2. Your complete `lab_01.py` file with proper doc strings each function and test cases (disclaimer: if you don’t write test cases I will consider the function wrong)
