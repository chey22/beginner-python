<h2>Lab 0: Primer</h2>
(Lab 0 because Computer Scientists start counting at zero! üß†)

<h4>Deadline: First day of class</h4>


**I.  Overview**
	
Welcome to the first lab! This first lab is to get you used to basic command line/terminal commands as well as writing your first executable python file. Each lab will have different modules, or ‚Äúsections‚Äù that cover different areas that we will go over each week. Please know each lab is optional and is for you to practice. I am only putting deadlines for each so that I can guarantee I have enough time to grade for those who want them graded for feedback.

**II.  Module 1: Refresher on Data Types**

**III.  Module 2: Practice with Python Files**
1. Using an IDE of your choice, create a file called `hello_world.py` in your `lab_00` directory (you don‚Äôt have to use the command line for this)
2. On line 1, type `print(‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù)`
3. Save your file and run your script with the command line **(hint: python3 hello_world.py)**
4. Take a screenshot of the command line output
5. Download the `lab_00.py` file and complete the skeleton functions I have created for you. Instructions are listed under each function (hint: functions in Python are very similar to methods in Ruby)
6. Take a screenshot of each output from the functions

<h4>Deliverables:</h4>

1. A screenshot of the output from `hello_world.py`
2. A screenshot of all outputs from `lab_00.py`
